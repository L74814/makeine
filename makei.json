  "description": "“Huh? Who are you calling losing?”\n\nAs the background of the class, I, Kazuhiko Nukumizu, witnessed a popular girl–Anna Yanami, getting rejected by another guy.\n\n“Even though he said we’ll get married. Don’t you think he’s pretty mean?”\n“When did he say that?”\n“When we were 4 or 5 years old.”\n\nThat doesn’t count, right? With this, the losing heroines like Remon Yakishio from the Track and Field Club, and Chika Komari, from the literature club.\n\n“Nukumizu-kun. There are two types of girls. Childhood friends or cheating cats.”\n“I see. Well, that’s a bold statement.”\n\nThere’s a fortune for those who shine only after losing. Losing Heroines—The curtain to the mysterious coming-of-age story “Makeine” opens now!",
